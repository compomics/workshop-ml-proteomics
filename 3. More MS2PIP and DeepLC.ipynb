    "Let's start with quantification labels as an example. TMT and iTRAQ provide an ingenious method to label peptides from different samples (e.g. treatment and control), pool the samples together, identify all samples in a single run, and finally quantify peptides from each sample separately through peptide fragmentation. This can be achieved with the use of cleavable reporter ions. Each sample is labeled with a specific tag molecule with a distinct reporter ion mass. Thanks to a balance group on the whole label, the mass of the intact label is identical across samples. The result is that the peptides from each sample will group together in both MS1 and MS2 spectra, but after fragmentation, the reporter ions can be observed at distinct masses in the MS2 spectrum.\n",

    "\n",
    "To use spectrum predictions to improve peptide identification, we need to be able to compare predictions to observations. Simply put, for each set of observed spectrum and predicted spectrum, we need a number that reflect how similar both spectra are. This is not straightforward, as many factors influence the performance of such a _metric_. For MS²PIP, we usually calculate the Pearson correlation of total ion current normalized, log2-transformed spectra for all b- and y-ions. Normalizing to the total ion current simply means dividing all peak intensities by the sum of all intensity in the spectrum. The sum of all peak intensities in the spectrum is then 1. Logarithmic tranformation helps to de-emphasize the effect of the few high intensity peaks on the correlation metric and increases the influence of the many low intensity peaks. In our experience, this results in a more accurate Pearson correlation. As MS²PIP only predicts b- and y-ions, we only compare observed b- and y-ions with the predictions. If peaks are absent in the observed spectrum, we assume they are zero.\n",
